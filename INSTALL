Einhard uses cmake for easy building and installation.

Installation follows the usual cmake install path. From the top directory of einhard run:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

This will install the headers in /usr/local/include. For customization you can use the usual
cmake tools like ccmake or cmake-gui.
